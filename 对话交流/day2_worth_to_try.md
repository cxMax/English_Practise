## Paragraph
Hi,I'm Chris and i'm here today with LI.
Hello.
Did you see that Superman file on the television last night? I love Clark Kent.
By day,he's just a regular guy, but he also has a power to fly. it's a classic movie.
No, I didn't see it.The aerial on my roof is broken and I don't know how to fix it. So I can't watch anything at that moment.
That's a shame.If you want, I can have a look to see if I can fix it for you.
I'd be fly on the seat of my pants, but it's worth a try.
you can fly? like a superman?
No I don't mean I can actually fly,and I'm certainly not putting my underwear on over my trousers.
The phrase 'to fly by the seat of my paints' means to do something difficult without being trained to do it or really knowing how.
So I don't have to worry about actually seeing your paints?
No,Li, you don't have to see my pants. it's just a phrase.
I see, so you'll have a go at fixing my TV aerial, even though you aren't quit sure what you are doing.
Exactly, Let's hear some more examples of the phrase in action.
The report has to finished today but no one is here to show me how to do it.
I'll be flying by the seat of my pants, but i'd better try.
John is trying to put new tiles in the bathroom, as he won't pay for a decorator to do it.
He really is flying by the seat of his pants.
So this is a phrase that we can use when we know very little about something,
but you're going to do your best to complete the job.
People often use this phrase when they have to do a job quickly,but don't know how.
So do you think you can fix my aerial?
Well, I'll certainly give it a try, have you got a ladder, then?
Sure.
Well , there you go. I really did fly by the seat of my pants, but it looks like it's fixed.
Let me turn on the TV. It works. Great picture. You know what, Chris, even though you don't have your pants like Superman, you really are my hero.
Erm, thanks
